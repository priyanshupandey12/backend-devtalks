DevTalks
A networking platform designed to connect engineering students and developers. Find collaborators, mentors, and peers based on your skills, goals, and location.

üöÄ Key Features
Live GitHub Activity Status: User profiles display an activity ring (üü¢, üü°, ‚ö™Ô∏è) indicating their recent GitHub commit history. This helps you find currently active developers.

Advanced Skill & Role Search: Find the exact person you need. Search by specific programming languages (e.g., Python, React) or by development roles (e.g., "Frontend Developer," "UI/UX Designer," "Data Analyst").

Geospatial Radius Search: Discover developers within a specific geographic radius. Find collaborators in your city or within a 500km range, powered by MongoDB's geospatial queries.

Real-Time Chat: Instantly connect and collaborate with other users through a built-in, real-time messaging system (using Socket.io).

Goal-Oriented Matching: Filter users based on their primary goals, such as "Finding project partners," "Looking for a mentor," or "Learning a new skill."

Secure Authentication: Robust user login and registration with Google OAuth (using Passport.js) and secure password handling.

Cloud Image Uploads: User profile pictures are handled efficiently in memory (using Multer) and uploaded directly to Cloudinary, ensuring a stateless and scalable server.

Scheduled Jobs: A node-cron job runs automatically to periodically fetch and update GitHub activity for all users.
